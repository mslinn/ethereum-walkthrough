Welcome to the **Go Ethereum Walkthrough** gitbook! I’m excited to have you here and hope you will enjoy exploring the internals of the Go implementation of Ethereum as much as I have.

I’m [Mike Slinn](https://www.micronauticsresearch.com/#people), an independent consultant, software developer and technical instructor specializing in Ethereum and blockchain.

I can present this material interactively on line or in person anywhere in the world for an hour, a day, or over several days. I also offer software development and consultancy services with hands-on, in-depth workshops and mentoring. Reach out to me at [mslinn@micronauticsresearch.com](mailto:mslinn@micronauticsresearch.com) or [@mslinn](https://twitter.com/mslinn) to discuss opportunities.

Consider joining me at [SF Ethereum Developers](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Ethereum-Developers/) and [Silicon Valley Ethereum](https://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/) meetups.

This documentation includes text and code snippets from a variety of public sources, attributed appropriately, plus my own original writing.

I have produced this work using my own personal resources and my own time. No-one has paid me for this. Please sponsor my work! I intend to make free videos and tour the world presenting this information live. I have produced hundreds of instructional videos at [https://www.ScalaCourses.com](ScalaCourses.com), and I am ready to do the same for Ethereum and other blockchain projects. Right now I'm seeking corporate and foundation sponsorship; if your organization would like to become a sponsor, and get a lot of exposure to Ethereum developers world-wide, please email me at [mslinn@micronauticsresearch.com](mailto:mslinn@micronauticsresearch.com).
