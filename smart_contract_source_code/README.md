## Smart Contract Tour {#smart-contract-source-code}

The `core/vm` directory contains the files that implement the EVM. These files are part of the `vm` package. Let's look at two of them:

* `[contract.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/vm/contract.go)`, which defines smart contract behavior.
* `[contracts.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/vm/contracts.go)`, responsible for executing smart contracts on the EVM.
