# Types

[Remember](https://tour.golang.org/basics/3), publicly visible methods and properties in Go (those that are _exported_) are denoted by having names that start with a capital letter. Private scope is denoted by names starting with a lower-case letter.

This section describes critical data structures used in `go-ethereum`. The main categories of types defined by this documentation are:

* [Common](common.md) &ndash; foundational types used throughout
* [Database](database.md) &ndash; defines blockchain data structures
* [Peer to Peer](p2p.md) &ndash; defines Ethereum nodes
* [Smart Contract](smart_contract.md) &ndash; defines data structures for smart contracts
